'''
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num: int) -> int:
        binary=str(bin(num)[2:])        
        integer=""
        for i in range(len(binary)):
            if binary[i] == '0':
                integer+='1'
            else:
                integer+='0'
        return int(integer,2)
